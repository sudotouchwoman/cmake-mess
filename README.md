# Test project for messing with CMake.

As far as I can tell, the entire `build` subfolder can be gitignored, the only thing important to leave is `CMakeLists.txt` and the script to build project (`build.sh`).

The opportunities CMake provides are great, one should use it wisely enough. However, yet I haven't used it for debugging *really messy*  and complicated code. How *complicated* would it become when several developers were working on various parts of the same project?
